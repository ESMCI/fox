<h1>Installing FoX</h1>

<p>FoX requires a Fortran-95 compiler. Fortran 90 is <em>not</em> sufficient. No non-standard features are required, though.</p>

<p>It is primarily tested using NAG f95 (version 5.1) and g95, on both of which compilers it works correctly.</p>

<p>Some problems are known to occur with older versions of some compilers - if you encounter such problems please upgrade.</p>

<p>The following compilers have been tested.</p>

<p>Intel version 8.x(linux-ia32): works partly with <code>-DBROKEN_COMPILER</code> (will compile without, but fail later)
      version 9.1(linux-ia32): works correctly, passes all tests
PGI version 6.1(linux-ia32): fails - bug report made.
XLF version 9.1(powerpc-aix): works entirely, passes all tests
NAG version 5.1(linux-ia32,osx-ppc): works entirely
g95 2006-08-01(linux-ia32,osx-ppc): works entirely (with the exception of two bugs in str, under investigation)
Pathscale 2.4(linux-x86_64): fails completely</p>

<p>If you have difficulty compiling, try adding
<code>-DBROKEN_COMPILER</code> to <code>FPPFLAGS</code> in <code>arch.make</code>
This will give you reduced functionality in the area of 
floating point output, but should otherwise work.</p>

<p>Go into top-level directory:</p>

<p>Type</p>

<pre><code> `config/configure`
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a file <code>arch.make</code> with hopefully the correct settings for your compiler.</p>

<p>If you have more than one compiler installed, you can direct the configure script to find the correct compiler by doing:</p>

<pre><code> config/configure --FC=/path/to/compiler
</code></pre>

<p>You ought not to need to, but you may wish to adapt the compiler flags; this can be done by editing <code>arch.make</code> by hand.</p>

<p>To actually compile the library, simply type <code>make</code></p>

<p>Assuming successful compilation, you can run the test-suite by doing</p>

<pre><code>make check
</code></pre>
