# FoX versioning

This documentation describes version 2.0 of the FoX library

FoX was originally based on the version 1.2 of the [xmlf90](http://lcdx00.wm.lc.ehu.es/ag/xml/) library, but has since evolved heavily.

This release version includes only output modules.

(which is a further development of the xmlf90 library, last released as version 1.2)

This is a stable branch, which will be maintained with important bugfixes, but on which no further major development will occur.

Version 2.0 has support for outputting complete XML documents, with support for all XML objects described in XML11, and XML Names. FIXME. A detailed description of its precise conformance level is at [FIXME] link.

In addition, there is a large suite of routines available for outputting valid [CML](http://www.xml-cml.org) documents.

Input modules are under development for SAX, DOM, and XPath, and will be released with version 2.1.
