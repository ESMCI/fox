Things to do:

* Make buffer pseudo-dynamical to avoid limitations. - in fact completely remove buffer_t & use character arrays
* Insert code to deal with XML declarations (really processing instructions)
  which are not of the form
  
 <?name  pseudo_att_name="pseudo_att_value" .... ?>

* check for all hard-coded limitations
* share dictionary, elstack, etc between here & wxml.
* use fsys/pxf where approriate
* share error-handling where appropriate
* rename everything sax-specific to have sax in the name
* make sure and use implicit none/private everywhere
* make sure and explicitly declare all USEd symbols
