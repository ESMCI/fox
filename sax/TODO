Things to do:

* Make buffer pseudo-dynamical to avoid limitations. - in fact completely remove buffer_t & use character arrays
* Insert code to deal with XML declarations (really processing instructions)
  which are not of the form
  
 <?name  pseudo_att_name="pseudo_att_value" .... ?>

* check for all hard-coded limitations
* make sure and use implicit none/private everywhere DONE
* make sure and explicitly declare all USEd symbols
* proper checking for QNames in tag & attribute names
* namespace support for attributes DONE
* prefix mapping callbacks.

* check input/output uses of buffer

* check usage of element_name - when can we garbage-collect?

* Entity reparsing in text.
* characters handler.
* test: lots of. Probably use sax_example as driver
