XMLF90 package with modular components.

Example of integration into larger code.

Getting started quickly.

1. Get the source directories (this will pull in the sax, wxml, fsys,
and config modules)

baz build-config xmlf90.config       

2. Type "config/configure" to generate the compiler information

3. Type "make"
